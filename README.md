## Selected Projects

### Chess Engine & Game Logic
**Challenge:** Implement complex move validation and efficient state management with low latency.  
**Outcome:** Designed a modular chess engine in C++ using object-oriented patterns to manage board state, piece behavior, and rule enforcement.  
**Stack:** C++, STL  

---

### Low-Level Graphics Simulation
**Challenge:** Build interactive graphical software without relying on high-level engines.  
**Outcome:** Developed a Breakout-style simulation in 16-bit Assembly using direct memory access and interrupt handling for real-time input and rendering.  
**Stack:** x86 Assembly, NASM, DOSBox  

---

### Full-Stack Scalable Architecture
**Challenge:** Design a modular, secure system for dynamic content delivery.  
**Outcome:** Architected a MERN-based application using Next.js for server-side rendering and Express middleware for authentication and request handling.  
**Stack:** Next.js, Express, MongoDB, TypeScript

## Engineering Philosophy

I approach software development with an emphasis on **performance, clarity, and long-term maintainability**.

- **Clarity over Complexity:** Prefer readable, logically structured solutions over clever abstractions.  
- **First-Principles Thinking:** Analyze problems from hardware and OS fundamentals upward.  
- **Iterative Refinement:** Continuously improve both execution efficiency and developer experience.
