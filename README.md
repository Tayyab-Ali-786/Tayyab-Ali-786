# Hi there, I'm Tayyab Ali! 👋

### 🎓 BSCS Student at FAST-NUCES
I am a passionate Software Engineering student currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science. I have a strong foundation in C++ for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and I am currently on a journey to master the Full Stack development world.

### 🚀 About Me
- 🔭 I’m currently working on building scalable full-stack applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently sharpening my skills in **Next.js** and **Advanced Node.js**.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy low-level programming as much as high-level web dev—I've even built a game in 16-bit Assembly!
